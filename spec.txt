🛠️ Design Customization Tips
Refine Your Layout
Use iterative prompts like:

"Make the hero background more dynamic with animated gradients"

"Add parallax effects to the features section"

"Enhance pricing cards with hover transitions"

"Include a dark mode toggle in the navbar"

Visual Enhancements

Color: “Shift primary blue to a warmer purple tone”

Typography: “Use an alternate font stack for headings”

Spacing: “Increase vertical rhythm between sections”

Components: “Add a floating action button for demo requests”

💬 Pro Prompting Strategy
Before making edits, clarify your goal.
Instead of: “Make it better”
Try: “Add a soft glow to the CTA button and increase its size by 20%”

Break complex ideas into phases
Example:

❌ "Add login, dashboard, and user system"

✅ "First, implement a login modal with email/password fields"

Reference existing components
E.g., “Use the card style from the Features section for the new Testimonials carousel”
